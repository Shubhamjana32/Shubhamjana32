## Hi there 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on Expanding the features and UX of my Privacy-First Personal Finance Dashboard with advanced data visualization, while strictly adhering to client-side storage principles.

🌱 I’m currently learning Deepening my knowledge of React.js for building scalable Single-Page Applications (SPAs) and exploring robust Front-End testing methodologies.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects focused on data privacy, innovative front-end architecture, or utility libraries written in Vanilla JavaScript.

🤔 I’m looking for help with Best practices for optimizing the performance and loading speeds of complex, data-heavy, client-side web applications.

💬 Ask me about Zero-Server Architecture, Client-Side Storage (LocalStorage/IndexedDB), JavaScript, and rapid UI development using Tailwind CSS.

📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-jana-3b650628a/overlay/about-this-profile/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BVkU%2BmYipR4mpK8SBthUWIA%3D%3D ) or email me at devshubhamjana@gmail.com.

⚡ Fun fact:I've built a fully functional web app with persistent data that runs entirely on the browser, proving you don't always need a backend server!
